    <h1>Presenting User Research</h1>
    
    <p>
        Research can be read on different frequencies. When it comes to talking about it to an outsider itâ€™s possible for them to view it as a scrappy assortment of statements. Something needs to be done to make sense of it.
    </p>
    <h2>Communicating your findings</h2>
    <p>This is where a narrative comes in. Not just a structure of your presentation but a holistic view on the how the research contributes to the project.</p>
